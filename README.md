# Oscars
The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry. Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. I wanted to visualize the diversity in academy awards (Oscar awards), but I was unable to find a complete dataset of all nominations and winners for all categories with their respective gender and ethnicity from 1927 to 2020. I found a basic dataset from Kaggle, but it did not have gender and race of the nominations and winners.
